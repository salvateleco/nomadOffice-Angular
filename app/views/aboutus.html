                    <p>“Coworking hinges on the belief that innovation and inspiration
                        come from cross pollination of different people in different fields
                        or specializations.  Random opportunities and discoveries that arise
                        from interactions with others – also dubbed ‘accelerated serendipity’
                        – play a large role in coworking.”</p>

                  Traditionally, society forces us to choose between working at home for ourselves
                  or working at an office for a company. If we work at a traditional 9 to 5 company
                  job, we get community and structure, but lose freedom and the ability to control
                  our own lives. If we work for ourselves at home, we gain independence but suffer
                  loneliness and bad habits from not being surrounded by a work community. Coworking
                  is a solution to this problem." Brad Neuberg, first person to use the term "Coworking"
                  and founder of first coworking space (The Spiral Muse in San Fransisco).
